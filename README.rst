Pipetools
=========

``pipetools`` is a python package that enables function composition similar to
using Unix pipes.

Inspired by Pipe_ and Околомонадное_ (whatever that means...)

.. _Pipe: http://dev-tricks.net/pipe-infix-syntax-for-python
.. _Околомонадное: http://honeyman.livejournal.com/122675.html?nojs=1


It allows piping of arbitrary functions and comes with a few handy shortcuts.

Why?
----

Pipetools attempt to simplify function composition and make it more readable.

Why piping instead of regular composition?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
I believe it to be easier to read, write and think about from left to right /
top to bottom in the order that it's actually executed, instead of reversed
order as it is with regular function composition (``(f • g)(x) == f(g(x))``).


Example
-------

Say you want to create a list of python files in a given directory, ordered by
filename length, as a string, each file on one line and also with line numbers::

    >>> print pyfiles_by_length('../pipetools')
    0. main.py
    1. utils.py
    2. __init__.py
    3. ds_builder.py


So you might write it like this::

    def pyfiles_by_length(directory):
        all_files = os.listdir(directory)
        py_files = [f for f in all_files if f.endswith('.py')]
        py_files.sort(key=len)
        numbered = enumerate(py_files)
        rows = ("{0}. {1}".format(i, f) for i, f in numbered)
        return '\n'.join(rows)

Or perhaps like this::

    def pyfiles_by_length(directory):
        return '\n'.join('{0}. {1}'.format(*x) for x in enumerate(sorted(
            [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith('.py')], key=len)))

Or, if you're a mad scientist, you would probably do it like this::

    pyfiles_by_length = lambda d: (reduce('{0}\n{1}'.format,
        map(lambda x: '%d. %s' % x, enumerate(sorted(
            filter(lambda f: f.endswith('.py'), os.listdir(d)), key=len)))))


But *there should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it*.

So which one is it? Well, to redeem the situation, ``pipetools`` give you yet
another possibility!

::

    pyfiles_by_length = (pipe
        | os.listdir
        | where(X.endswith('.py'))
        | sort_by(len)
        | enumerate
        | foreach("{0}. {1}")
        | '\n'.join
    )


So is this `The Right Way™`_? Probably not, but I think it's pretty cool, so you
should give it a try! Read on to see how it works.

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install pipetools

`Uh, what's that? <http://www.pip-installer.org>`_


Usage
-----

.. _the-pipe:

The pipe
""""""""
The ``pipe`` object can be used to pipe functions together to
form new functions, and it works like this::

    from pipetools import pipe

    f = pipe | a | b | c

    f(x) == c(b(a(x)))


A real example, sum of odd numbers from 0 to *x*::

    from functools import partial
    from itertools import ifilter
    from pipetools import pipe

    odd_sum = pipe | xrange | partial(ifilter, lambda x: x % 2) | sum

    odd_sum(10)  # -> 25


Note that the chain up to the `sum` is lazy.


Automatic partial application in the pipe
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As partial application is often useful when piping things together, it is done
automatically when the *pipe* encounters a tuple, so this produces the same
result as the previous example::

    odd_sum = pipe | xrange | (ifilter, lambda x: x % 2) | sum

As of ``0.1.9``, this is even more powerful, see `X-partial  <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/xpartial.html>`_.


Built-in tools
""""""""""""""

Pipetools contain a set of *pipe-utils* that solve some common tasks. For
example there is a shortcut for the ifilter from our example, called
`where() <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html#pipetools.utils.where>`_::

    from pipetools import pipe, where

    odd_sum = pipe | xrange | where(lambda x: x % 2) | sum

Well that might be a bit more readable, but not really a huge improvement, but
wait!

If a *pipe-util* is used as first or second item in the pipe (which happens
quite often) the ``pipe`` at the beginning can be omitted::

    odd_sum = xrange | where(lambda x: x % 2) | sum


See `pipe-utils' documentation <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html>`_.


OK, but what about the ugly lambda?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

`where() <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html#pipetools.utils.where>`_, but also `foreach() <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html#pipetools.utils.foreach>`_,
`sort_by() <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html#pipetools.utils.sort_by>`_ and other `pipe-utils <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html>`_ can be
quite useful, but require a function as an argument, which can either be a named
function -- which is OK if it does something complicated -- but often it's
something simple, so it's appropriate to use a ``lambda``. Except Python's
lambdas are quite verbose for simple tasks and the code gets cluttered...

**X object** to the rescue!

::

    from pipetools import where, X

    odd_sum = xrange | where(X % 2) | sum


How 'bout that.

`Read more about the X object and it's limitations. <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/xobject.html>`_


.. _auto-string-formatting:

Automatic string formatting
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Since it doesn't make sense to compose functions with strings, when a pipe (or a
`pipe-util <http://0101.github.io/pipetools/doc/pipeutils.html>`_) encounters a string, it attempts to use it for
`(advanced) formatting`_::

    >>> countdown = pipe | (xrange, 1) | reversed | foreach('{0}...') | ' '.join | '{0} boom'
    >>> countdown(5)
    u'4... 3... 2... 1... boom'

.. _(advanced) formatting: http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatstrings


Feeding the pipe
""""""""""""""""

Sometimes it's useful to create a one-off pipe and immediately run some input
through it. And since this is somewhat awkward (and not very readable,
especially when the pipe spans multiple lines)::

    result = (pipe | foo | bar | boo)(some_input)

It can also be done using the ``>`` operator::

    result = some_input > pipe | foo | bar | boo

Which also isn't ideal, but I couldn't think of anything better so far...


But wait, there is more
